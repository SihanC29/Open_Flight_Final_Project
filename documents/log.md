# Development Log 

## Week 1 (Date: 10/30/2022 -- 11/05/2022)
#### Weekly Goals
Our goal this week is to set up the regulations in our group, decide the topic of our final project, and create our GitHub repo. We have successfully finished all of our goals, though in a hurry.

#### Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)
We all participated in selecting dataset and algorithms.
Sihan Cheng (sihanc6): Completed Team Contract and Development Log 1.
Mingqi Wang (mingqiw2): Finished and modified Project Proposal, especially the Algorithm part, and built the GitHub Repo
Kelly Dai (jingyud2): Modified Project Proposal(Data correction and Data storage) and Team Contract.
Teresa Zhang (lingyiz4): Finished Project Proposal Leading Question, Data Format and Timeline part.

#### Problems Encountered 
We overall worked well but we did not plan on the workflow as our first step, so things went a bit messy. Besides, all of us are way too busy, so sometimes it is hard to have everyone work on their part on time.

#### Plans for next week
We plan to start off by making a weekly plan, then splitting the work among each group member. We will do some further research regarding the project topic.

#### Optional: Questions for mentor


## Week 2 (Date: 11/06/2022 -- 11/12/2022)

#### Weekly Goals
Our goal this week is to discuss and review the project proposal with the mentor's feedback and then assign tasks (such as cleaning data and building algorithms) to each group member for next week.

#### Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)
Sihan Cheng (sihanc6): Reviewed the Project Proposal and completed Development Log 2.
Mingqi Wang (mingqiw2): Reviewed and modified the Project Proposal.
Kelly Dai (jingyud2): Reviewed and modified the Project Proposal.
Teresa Zhang (lingyiz4): Reviewed the Project Proposal and Assigned the tasks to group members.

#### Problems Encountered 
We achieved all the goals for this week perfectly.

#### Plans for next week
We will conduct further research on the topic, develop the algorithm, then clean the data, and we will finish our assigned parts by the end of next week.

#### Optional: Questions for mentor


## Week 3 (Date: 11/13/2022 -- 11/19/2022)

#### Weekly Goals
This week, our goal is to correct the errors in the development log and discuss the code for each algorithm. We also further reviewed our new version of the Project Proposal for regrading. We set up new regulations to review our submitted work prior to the due date, to make sure everything is errorless.

#### Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)
Sihan Cheng (sihanc6): Reviewed the Project Proposal, found some errors, and completed Development Log 3.
Mingqi Wang (mingqiw2): Reviewed and modified the Project Proposal, and uploaded updates to GitHub.
Kelly Dai (jingyud2): Reviewed and modified the Project Proposal, and provided insights about algorithms.
Teresa Zhang (lingyiz4): Reviewed the Project Proposal and provided insights about algorithms.

#### Problems Encountered
We did not check our work very detailedly earlier so some may contain unexpected errors. We also did not stick with our plan very strictly.

#### Plans for next week
We will plan for next week's tasks after the regrade for the Project Proposal is completed.

#### Optional: Questions for mentor


## Week 4 (Date: 11/20/2022 -- 12/02/2022)

#### Weekly Goals
This week, we aimd to finish the pagerank algorithm and prepared for the mid project checkins. We also decided to start to work on BFS if possible.

#### Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)
Sihan Cheng (sihanc6): Fixed bugs, improved PageRank.cpp and airportGraph.cpp, and completed Development Log 4.
Mingqi Wang (mingqiw2): Finished most of the coding work for PageRank.cpp, and uploaded updates to GitHub.
Kelly Dai (jingyud2): Finished the construction of the airport class, and provided insights regarding the algorithms.
Teresa Zhang (lingyiz4): Finished most of the coding work for airportGraph.cpp, and explained the algorithms to our mentor in the zoom mid project checkins.

#### Problems Encountered 
Nothing so far.

#### Plans for next week
We want to construct BFS next week. We will start by writing pseudocode for the functions.

#### Optional: Questions for mentor
