# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 
We will meet on Mondays and Fridays via zoom and each meeting will last approximately 50 minutes. There will be a note taker who will take notes on a google doc. 
2. **Assistance** 
We have a group chat on Discord and we all agree that we will check the message regularly, so we should expect that there will always be responses within 2 hours.

3. **Respect** 
We have a Discord channel/forum that allows every one of us to speak out our thoughts. We all agree that we will comment under those posts to make sure all the thoughts are noticed.

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
We will evenly distribute the coding work. When there comes unexpected work, we all agree that we will spend extra time to solve the problem ASAP.

5. **Time Commitment** 
4 hours/week is the bottom line. We do understand sometimes things may get out of control, so adjustments are always acceptable. 

6. **Conflict Resolution** 
We formed the group because we all share similar opinions so conflicts are very unlikely to happen. We have already made our own regulations on meeting policy to ensure everyone meets on time and contributes. If we encounter some issues, for example, one of us is not submitting the work on time, we will discuss the problem in our meeting and give whoever is "in trouble" a second chance. If that person is still not finishing the task on time, we may report the issue to the course staff.
